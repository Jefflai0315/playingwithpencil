    st.markdown(''' ‚ÄúFlow profiling‚Äù is about controling the flow rate of water going through the machine‚Äôs boiler and the puck of coffee.
     The quality of an espresso shot depends on 3 things: coffee grind size, coffee to water ratio and time.
     Although the espresso machine I have at home can dispense water for a preset amount of time, 
     I wouldn't trust the dispensing as every pull of espresso can **never be the same**.  (e.g. different coffee type with same grind size setting and same amount of coffee can take different time to get the correct coffee to water ratio ). ''')

    ##### Advantages:
    
    1. I no longer need to hold down the dispensing button. And enjoy watching the thick espresso pull out of the portafiler!
    2. I am able to study the flow profilling data collected, so that I can alter the grind size of my newly bought coffee beans.
    3. Show that I can make simple modifications to my espresso machine to save some bucks for upgrading my machine :D
    """)

    st.markdown("""
    ##### Restropective:
    
    1. Since the button is only found on my Streamlit app now, it can be incovenient if I do not have any devices with me. It will be good if I can have a physical button beside the machine to change the state of the machine.
    2. The electrical components and wirings are exposed and placed close to a liquid dispenser's boiler. I will need to alter the length of the wires such that I can keep the electrical components away/ at the side or top of the espresso machine. It will be nice if i can compact all the parts into a small module.
    3. The servo arm is not ideal to ensure proper contact with the button. Besides, the current rotating angle / servo position should be reconsider as the motion is prompt to misalignment.
